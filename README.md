# 🌌 Pressure Field Theory of Gravity (PFTG-MinimalRelic) — v2.0

This project presents a testable, unified theory of gravity that eliminates the need for dark matter through scalar field dynamics.  
**PFTG-MinimalRelic** models gravity as pressure arising from vacuum energy gradients (Φ), replacing spacetime curvature with field-based interaction.
